# nhttpd - An educational and self-marketing project

When you're on the run for new projects, respectively business orders, your only chance is to show your skills. This is my aim for this repository. As a security expert and coding enthusiast I can kill two birds with one stone. However, this is my very first self-coded HTTP-Server, so there are a lot of things one can do better I think, but as we IT professionals say: Learning never stops!

Tools used in this project:

- Node.js
    - ip2location-nodejs
    - sprintf-js
    - csv-parser
- ECMAScript 2023
- HTML 5
